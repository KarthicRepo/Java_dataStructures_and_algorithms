# JavaDataStructuresAndAlgorithms


This repository has some of the common data-structures implemented using JAVA.
All these were implemented without any code reference, with pure uderstading of the internal working,
I've tried my best to put my own logic in most implementation.
I have given importance to Generics, so any objects of type comparable can be used in most of the Data-structure.


The implementation covers the below items,

BASIC SORTING
1) Bubble sort
2) Selection Sort
3) Insertion Sort
4) Sort using Array Utils
5) Sort using Collections Utils

ADVANCE SORTING
1) Merge Sort
2) Shell Sort
3) Quick Sort

BASIC DATASTRUCTURES
1) Stack
2) Queue
3) PriorityQueue
4) DoubleEndedQueue

INTERMEDIATE DATASTRUCTURES
1) Single Linked List
2) Double Linked List

ADVANCED DATASTRUCTURES
1) Binary Search Tree
2) 2-3-4 Tree
3) AVL Tree.
